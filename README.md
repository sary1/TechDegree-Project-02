## List Pagination and Filtering

#### **_Meets Expectations Tasks:_**
* No inline JavaScript. All JS is linked from an external file.
* Uses unobtrusive JavaScript to append markup for the pagination links. So none of the pagination link's markup is added into the HTML.
* Pagination links are created. If there are 44 students, 5 links should be generated, if there’s 66 students, 7 links should be generated. Etc.
* The first 10 students are shown when the page loads, and each pagination link displays the correct students.
* Clicking on “1” in the pagination links should show students 1 to 10. Clicking “2” shows 11 to 20. Clicking “5” shows students 41 to 50, and so on.
* Code comments have been added explaining how the functions work.

#### **_Exceeds Expectations Challenges:_**
* Use unobtrusive JavaScript to append HTML for a search bar.
* Pagination links display based on how many search results are returned. For example: if 10 or fewer results are returned, 0 or 1 pagination links are displayed. If 22 search results are returned, 3 pagination links are displayed.
* When a search yields 0 results, a message is displayed on the page, informing the user that no results have been found.
